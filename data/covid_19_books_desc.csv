Mentre i malati si moltiplicano e alcuni soccombono a una polmonite virale particolarmente aggressiva, i laboratori riescono rapidamente a isolare il responsabile della malattia: è un nuovo coronavirus, simile a quello della SARS che tra il 2002 e il 2003 aveva spaventato il mondo. Rispetto alla SARS, la nuova malattia è meno mortale ma molto più contagiosa, e ben presto la Cina è costretta a fare i conti con quella che per le autorità è “la più grave emergenza sanitaria nella storia della Repubblica popolare” e che per l’Organizzazione mondiale della sanità è “una minaccia peggiore del terrorismo”. E davanti ai contagi e alle morti provocati dal coronavirus, anche l’Italia è obbligata a prendere misure senza precedenti per fermare l’epidemia.In questo libro, Roberto Burioni attinge – insieme a Pier Luigi Lopalco, esperto epidemiologo – alla sua lunga esperienza di medico e ricercatore per mostrare la natura e il funzionamento dei virus, il loro passaggio (spillover) dagli animali all’uomo, l’evoluzione delle nostre conoscenze scientifiche, gli effetti devastanti delle epidemie nella storia dell’umanità e le battaglie combattute nell’ultimo secolo contro i nostri nemici più piccoli e più feroci.<br />Il nuovo coronavirus è una sfida alla nostra società avanzata.

And how?<br /><br />Over the past fifty years, more than three hundred infectious diseases have either newly emerged or reemerged, appearing in territories where they’ve never been seen before. Ninety percent of epidemiologists expect that one of them will cause a deadly pandemic sometime in the next two generations. It could be Ebola, avian flu, a drug-resistant superbug, or something completely new. While we can’t know which pathogen will cause the next pandemic, by unraveling the story of how pathogens have caused pandemics in the past, we can make predictions about the future. In <i>Pandemic: Tracking Contagions, from</i> <i>Cholera to Ebola and Beyond</i>, the prizewinning journalist Sonia Shah—whose book on malaria, <i>The Fever</i>, was called a “tour-de-force history” (<i>The New York Times</i>) and “revelatory” (<i>The New</i> <i>Republic</i>)—interweaves history, original reportage, and personal narrative to explore the origins of contagions, drawing parallels between cholera, one of history’s most deadly and disruptive pandemic-causing pathogens, and the new diseases that stalk humankind today.<br /><br />To reveal how a new pandemic might develop, Sonia Shah tracks each stage of cholera’s dramatic journey, from its emergence in the South Asian hinterlands as a harmless microbe to its rapid dispersal across the nineteenth-century world, all the way to its latest beachhead in Haiti. Along the way she reports on the pathogens now following in cholera’s footsteps, from the MRSA bacterium that besieges her own family to the never-before-seen killers coming out of China’s wet markets, the surgical wards of New Delhi, and the suburban backyards of the East Coast.<br /><br />By delving into the convoluted science, strange politics, and checkered history of one of the world’s deadliest diseases, <i>Pandemic </i>reveals what the next global contagion might look like— and what we can do to prevent it.",23847947,False,eng,288,1539,"Pandemic: Tracking Contagions, from Cholera to Ebola and Beyond"

[Stevie J. Cole],4.31,"Standalone in the rock star romance series, Pandemic Sorrow.<br /><br />My life had been no fairy tale. Actually, growing up, it had been something more like a nightmare, which is why I ended up so hard. When you don't want to hurt having the ability to be numb is your best defense mechanism. And for a long time all I was doing was existing.<br /><br />Jag Steele, the lead singer of the international rock band Pandemic Sorrow, was the epitome of everything I despised: arrogant, entitled, but the thing I hated most about him was that he was an addict. Drugs had been the demon that had ruined everything in my life, and anyone who had a love affair with them pretty much made my stomach turn. It brought up memories I wanted to stay buried. Needless to say, I wasn't exactly a fan of Jag.<br /><br />Funny thing is, people aren't always who you expect them to be. Never in a million years would I have thought the night I meet Jag would have any significance on the rest of my life, but it did. <br /><br />I found out that sometimes something that screams utter destruction might actually be your saving grace.<br /><br />Some people may say our story is too screwed up to be a romance, but for two broken people, we made the pieces fit together perfectly.",25190788,False,eng,326,155,"Roxy (Pandemic Sorrow, #3)"
